# NY-Times
The application is developed for Neosoft Internal project. This app follows Android Architectural Components and offline caching

# Project Highlights:
1. MVVM Architectural pattern
2. Unit testing using JUnit and Mockito
3. UI unit testing using Espresso
4. Offline data caching

The application uses **OkHttp Caching Interceptor** to store data for offline mode. It follows **MVVM Architecture pattern**. As MVVM pattern is ultimately the modern structure of the MVC pattern, so the main goal is still the same to provide a clear separation between domain logic and presentation layer. Application uses **Live Data** to observe data changes and update views accordingly.
